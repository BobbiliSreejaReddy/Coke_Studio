Djokovic was transported to a government detention hotel, after being held at Melbourne Airport for several hours. The tennis star had claimed an exemption from Australia's coronavirus vaccine requirement, on the grounds that he'd recently recovered from the virus. He might not get a chance to set the men's record of 21 major championships at the Australian Open.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed the controversy at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nSubscribe to our channel for all our latest in-depth, on the ground reporting from around the world."

                    "description": "\u25ba Subscribe to Sky Sports News: http://bit.ly/SkySportsNewsSub\n\nNovak Djokovic is set to be deported from Australia after the country's Federal Court rejected an appeal against the re-cancellation of his visa.\n\nThree Federal Court judges upheld a decision made on Friday by the immigration minister to cancel the 34-year-old Serb's visa on public interest grounds.\n\nThe full reasons behind the court's unanimous ruling will be published in the \"coming days\".\n\nThere was the possibility of a further legal challenge but it was confirmed half an hour after the ruling that Djokovic was not seeking that option.\n\nDjokovic, whose trouble entering Australia has centred around his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19, had been scheduled to begin his quest on Monday for a record-extending 10th Australian Open title and 21st Grand Slam crown but now looks set to be replaced in the draw.\n\n#SkySportsNews #SkySports #NovakDjokovic\n   \nMore from Sky Sports on YouTube:\n\n\u25ba Sky Sports Retro: http://bit.ly/SkySportsRetroSub\n\u25ba Sky Sports: http://bit.ly/SkySportsSub\n\u25ba Sky Sports Football: http://bit.ly/SSFootballSub\n\u25ba Sky Sports Boxing: http://bit.ly/SSBoxingSub\n\u25ba Sky Sports F1: http://bit.ly/SubscribeSkyF1\n\u25ba Sky Sports Cricket: http://bit.ly/SubscribeSkyCricket\n\u25ba Sky Sports Golf: https://bit.ly/SubscribeSkySportsGolf"

Australia has cancelled the visa of the men's world number one, setting him up for deportation. His lawyers are contesting the entry ban, with a court hearing scheduled for Monday (Jan 10). Djokovic arrived in Melbourne last night, but did not get past border control. The Serb was held at the airport for several hours before being taken to a quarantine hotel. The row centres on a medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination requirements, which Djokovic says he had received to play in the tournament.\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://cna.asia/youtubesub \r\n\r\nSubscribe to our news service on Telegram: https://cna.asia/telegram\r\n\r\nFollow us:\r\nCNA: https://cna.asia\r\nCNA Lifestyle: http://www.cnalifestyle.com \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia\r\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",

The row centres on a medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination requirements, which Djokovic says he had received to play in the tournament.\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://cna.asia/youtubesub \r\n\r\nSubscribe to our news service on Telegram: https://cna.asia/telegram\r\n\r\nFollow us:\r\nCNA: https://cna.asia\r\nCNA Lifestyle: http://www.cnalifestyle.com \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia\r\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia"

                "description": "Novak Djokovic says he is extremely disappointed over his deportation from Australia after losing an appeal against his visa cancellation. \nThree judges upheld the decision made by the country's immigration minister that the tennis star posed a threat to public health. The verdict comes after a ten-day battle between the Serb and the Australian authorities over his vaccine exemption status. Djokovic has left Australia and could face a three-year ban from the country. The full reasoning behind the ruling will be published in the coming days.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n\u25baFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n\u25baTwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\u25baInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nF\u00fcr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#NovakDjokovic #Australia #Covid19",

                    "description": "Novak Djokovic says he is extremely disappointed over his deportation from Australia after losing an appeal against his visa cancellation. \nThree judges upheld the decision made by the country's immigration minister that the tennis star posed a threat to public health. The verdict comes after a ten-day battle between the Serb and the Australian authorities over his vaccine exemption status. Djokovic has left Australia and could face a three-year ban from the country. The full reasoning behind the ruling will be published in the coming days.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n\u25baFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n\u25baTwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\u25baInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nF\u00fcr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#NovakDjokovic #Australia #Covid19"
