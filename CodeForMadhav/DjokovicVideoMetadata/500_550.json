And some traces still stay there when I'm passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is approaching.\n\"The person checking my passport - are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go? I must admit I have that feeling.\"\nDjokovic also said \"I don't hold any resentment\", adding: \"I don't hold a grudge.\n\"I came like right away the year after in 2023...and I won the Australian Open - it was my 22nd slam.\n\"My parents and whole team were there, and it was actually one of the most emotional wins that I've ever had considering all that I'd been through the year before.\"\nDjokovic has the most Australian Open singles titles of any male player, having triumphed 10 times to date, and is aiming for a record 25th grand slam when he competes in Melbourne this year.",
