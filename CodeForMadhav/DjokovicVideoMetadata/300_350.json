The original link is here: https://rumble.com/vsphzb-australias-deportation-of-novak-djokovic.html\n\nNote that the Australian government, in deporting Djokovic, did not contend that he posed a threat to the public health due to a risk of transmitting COVID. The opposite is true: the government acknowledged that he qualified for a legal exemption from the vaccine requirement to enter the country given that he just contracted COVID as reflected by a December 16 positive test, followed by a negative test on December 22, and therefore has high levels of natural immunity. That is why he received a legal visa to enter Australia despite being unvaccinated. The proffered justification from Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, who cancelled his visa and ordered him deported, was that Djokovic\u2019s statements in April, 2020 implied that he was skeptical of vaccines, and the presence of someone in Australia who is viewed as an \u201cicon\u201d of personal choice would foster social disruption and \u201cexcite\u201d anti-vaccine sentiments.\n\nIn other words, the principle just embraced by the Australian government and upheld by its judicial system (whose hands were largely tied due to the virtually absolute power vested in the government) is that anyone who has ever expressed any skepticism over vaccines in general, or the COVID vaccine in particular, can and should be denied entrance to the country and be prevented from pursuing their livelihood \u2014 even though the government admits they pose no threat to the public health by transmitting the virus to others. Immigration lawyers and civil liberties activists in the country are warning of the grave dangers posed to everyone from this precedent, and I examine all of the implications of this decision.",

                "description": "It is no secret that World No. 1 tennis player Novak Djokovic has not favoured getting himself vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. Over the last year, while the world witnessed several COVID-19 waves owing to virus mutations, the Serbian star has time and again hit the headlines over his 'anti-vaxxer' status. Ahead of the Australian Open 2022, the defending champion has again found himself in the middle of controversy.\n\nWhile Tennis Australia gave Novak Djokovic a medical exemption to participate in the Australian Open 2022, the Border Force rejected the Serbian's visa putting his participation in the first Grand Slam of the year in limbo. Djokovic has launched a court bid to stop the federal government from deporting him.\n\nThe ongoing saga boils down to the sentiment Novak Djokovic has held over COVID-19 vaccinations. Even as the world grapples to take measures to deal with the pandemic amidst the Omicron variant surge, the tennis star continues to leave the fraternity perplexed over his indifferent stance.\n\nExplaining why he is unwilling to take the Covid-19 vaccine, Novak Djokovic, in 2020, had stated that he is not against the shot in general. However, he said he did not want to get inoculated because the virus constantly mutates, and the vaccines are not 100% effective against it.\n\n\"My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body, which I do not want, it is unacceptable to me,\" the Australian Open defending champion stated.\n\n\"I am not against vaccination of any kind because who am I to speak about vaccines when there are people that have been in the field of medicine and saving lives around the world?\" Djokovic remarked. \n\n\"I'm sure there are COVID-19 vaccines that have little side effects, have helped people, and helped stop the spread of some infections world over,\" the Serbian added.\n\nExplaining his viewpoint against the COVID-19 vaccines, Novak Djokovic further commented that we could not expect the jab to solve our problem when the novel coronavirus mutates regularly.\n\nNovak Djokovic had a Facebook session with several fellow Serbian athletes last year and spoke about when taking the COVID-19 shot would become mandatory for him to participate in tennis tournaments globally.\n\n\"I am opposed to COVID-19 vaccination, and I wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine to be able to travel. But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision,\" Djokovic remarked.\n\n\"I have my thoughts about the matter, and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don't know,\" the World No.1 tennis player concluded.\n\nFast-forwarding to 2022, being vaccinated against coronavirus is a mandate for sporting bodies worldwide. Tennis Australia (TA) had mandated that all participants at the tournament be vaccinated against COVID-19. Those who are not vaccinated have to have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts.\n\nAlthough Novak Djokovic has not publicly confirmed his current COVID-19 vaccination status, the fact remains that World No.1 has received a 'medical exemption' to participate in the Australian Open 2022. Time will tell if the defending champion will be able to take part in the Grand Slam where a win would take him past rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who are currently with him for the men's record of 20 career Grand Slam victories.\n\n#NovakDjokovic #AustralianOpen2022 #Covid19\n\n\ud83d\udd0a LIKE \u27a1 SHARE \u27a1 SUBSCRIBE\n\nFor More Updates:\n\nEnglish: https://newsable.asianetnews.com/\n\nHindi: https://hindi.asianetnews.com/\n\nMalayalam: https://www.asianetnews.com/\n\nKannada: https://kannada.asianetnews.com/\n\nTamil: https://tamil.asianetnews.com/\n\nTelugu: https://telugu.asianetnews.com/\n\nBengali: https://bangla.asianetnews.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AsianetNewsa...\n\nFollow us on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/AsianetNewsEN\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ann.newsable/\n\n\u27a1 If you like our video, give us a thumbs up and subscribe to our channel to get the daily dosage of news, entertainment, sports and more.",

The nine-time champion\u2019s torrid stay in Melbourne will end with his deportation from the country following a ruling by the Federal Court of Australia not to quash the decision by Immigration Minister Alex Hawke. Here Immigration Minister Alex Hawke cancels Djokovic\u2019s visa for a second time Djokovic reveals he is on his way to the Australian Open under a medical exemption. He writes on Instagram Djokovic immediately launches another legal challenge and in a hastily-arranged court hearing it emerges Hawke made his decision due to the possibility of Djokovic stoking anti-vaccination sentiment in Australia. Jan 15 Djokovic\u2019s title defence remains in doubt as the Immigration Minister ponders whether to override the court\u2019s ruling. A post shared by Novak Djokovic Jan 12 I\u2019ve spent fantastic quality time with my loved ones over the break and today I\u2019m heading Down Under with an exemption permission. Let\u2019s go 2022 he did not receive notification of the positive test until after the event. He also attributed an inaccuracy on his declaration form to an error from his agent. Jan 13 I want to stay and try to compete @AustralianOpen I remain focused on that. I flew here to play at one of the most important events we have in front of the amazing fans. \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/iJVbMfQ037 \u2014 Novak Djokovic  January 10 . I\u2019m pleased and grateful that the Judge overturned my visa cancellation. Despite all that has happened Documents show Djokovic was granted a vaccine exemption to enter Australia because he recorded a positive Covid-19 test in Serbia on December 16. However",

                    "description": "detention and deportation \u2013 Novak Djokovic\u2019s Australian Open saga Novak Djokovic will not defend his Australian Open title after the cancellation of his visa was upheld. The nine-time champion\u2019s torrid stay in Melbourne will end with his deportation from the country following a ruling by the Federal Court of Australia not to quash the decision by Immigration Minister Alex Hawke. Here Immigration Minister Alex Hawke cancels Djokovic\u2019s visa for a second time Djokovic reveals he is on his way to the Australian Open under a medical exemption. He writes on Instagram Djokovic immediately launches another legal challenge and in a hastily-arranged court hearing it emerges Hawke made his decision due to the possibility of Djokovic stoking anti-vaccination sentiment in Australia. Jan 15 Djokovic\u2019s title defence remains in doubt as the Immigration Minister ponders whether to override the court\u2019s ruling. A post shared by Novak Djokovic Jan 12 I\u2019ve spent fantastic quality time with my loved ones over the break and today I\u2019m heading Down Under with an exemption permission. Let\u2019s go 2022 he did not receive notification of the positive test until after the event. He also attributed an inaccuracy on his declaration form to an error from his agent. Jan 13 I want to stay and try to compete @AustralianOpen I remain focused on that. I flew here to play at one of the most important events we have in front of the amazing fans. \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/iJVbMfQ037 \u2014 Novak Djokovic  January 10 . I\u2019m pleased and grateful that the Judge overturned my visa cancellation. Despite all that has happened Documents show Djokovic was granted a vaccine exemption to enter Australia because he recorded a positive Covid-19 test in Serbia on December 16. However"
