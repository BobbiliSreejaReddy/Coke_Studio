The Victorian government said it was a matter for federal authorities.\"We've always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the federal government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors, \" Victoria's acting Sports Minister Jaala Pulford said. The visa cancellation came after the world's best men's player was left stranded overnight in a police-guarded room at Melbourne Airport after a 14-hour flight from Dubai.

                "description": "Novak Djokovic has been deported from Australia after the full federal court dismissed the bid to restore his visa. The unvaccinated star was left \u2018extremely disappointed\u2019 after the decision went against him to defend and win his 10th Australian Open crown and a record 21st Grand Slam title\n\nUsually a deportation order from Australia includes a three-year ban on return, but it can be waived under certain circumstances. Djokovic\u2019s lawyers termed the Australian immigration minister Alex Hawke\u2019s decision as \u201cillogical, irrational or unreasonable\u201d\n\nThe final decision has also caused an outrage in Australia. Supporters of the world no 1, outside the courtroom, fell short of words while his fans around the world took to social media to boycott the Grand Slam. However, the federal government has stood by its strict laws for the country to deal with the pandemic, indicating that no-one is \"above the law\"\n\nNow that the tennis star intended to \u2018rest and recuperate\u2019 after his visa saga, the French government announced that all athletes will have to be vaccinated in order to attend and compete in sporting events in France. Possibly, it would leave out the Serbian from another Grand Slam yet again.\n\n#NovakDjokovic #Australia #VisaCancellation\n -------------\nTo stay up to date with our latest videos, make sure to subscribe to this channel by click on the link: https://bit.ly/3g4XTYS",

                    "description": "Novak Djokovic has been deported from Australia after the full federal court dismissed the bid to restore his visa. The unvaccinated star was left \u2018extremely disappointed\u2019 after the decision went against him to defend and win his 10th Australian Open crown and a record 21st Grand Slam title\n\nUsually a deportation order from Australia includes a three-year ban on return, but it can be waived under certain circumstances. Djokovic\u2019s lawyers termed the Australian immigration minister Alex Hawke\u2019s decision as \u201cillogical, irrational or unreasonable\u201d\n\nThe final decision has also caused an outrage in Australia. Supporters of the world no 1, outside the courtroom, fell short of words while his fans around the world took to social media to boycott the Grand Slam. However, the federal government has stood by its strict laws for the country to deal with the pandemic, indicating that no-one is \"above the law\"\n\nNow that the tennis star intended to \u2018rest and recuperate\u2019 after his visa saga, the French government announced that all athletes will have to be vaccinated in order to attend and compete in sporting events in France. Possibly, it would leave out the Serbian from another Grand Slam yet again.\n\n#NovakDjokovic #Australia #VisaCancellation\n -------------\nTo stay up to date with our latest videos, make sure to subscribe to this channel by click on the link: https://bit.ly/3g4XTYS"

He will remain there until his appeal on Sunday.\n\nDjokovic's visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival in Melbourne on 6 January, after Australian Border Force officials said he had \"failed to provide appropriate evidence\" to receive a vaccine exemption.\n\nThe tennis star, who has caught Covid-19 twice with the latest positive test on 16 December, was detained for days at the immigration hotel.\n\nHis visa was then reinstated by a judge, who ordered his release, ruling that border officials had ignored correct procedure when he arrived.\n\nBut on Friday evening, Immigration Minister Alex Hawke once again cancelled Djokovic's visa under separate powers in Australia's Migration Act.\n\nThe act allows him to deport anyone he deems a potential risk to \"the health, safety or good order of the Australian community\".\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision had followed \"careful consideration\".\n\nAlluding to the heavy criticism his government has faced for allowing the unvaccinated player into Australia, Mr Morrison said: \"Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected.\"\n\nvisa, deportation, australia cancels novak djokovic\u2019s visa, australia news, djokovic visa,Australia, Novak Djokovic,Nine News Australia, Australian News, Latest news Australia, covid exemption, australia travel, visa cancelled,Australia, sports, Novak Djokovic, Novak Djokovic vaccine, Novak Djokovic visa,",

He will remain there until his appeal on Sunday.\n\nDjokovic's visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival in Melbourne on 6 January, after Australian Border Force officials said he had \"failed to provide appropriate evidence\" to receive a vaccine exemption.\n\nThe tennis star, who has caught Covid-19 twice with the latest positive test on 16 December, was detained for days at the immigration hotel.\n\nHis visa was then reinstated by a judge, who ordered his release, ruling that border officials had ignored correct procedure when he arrived.\n\nBut on Friday evening, Immigration Minister Alex Hawke once again cancelled Djokovic's visa under separate powers in Australia's Migration Act.\n\nThe act allows him to deport anyone he deems a potential risk to \"the health, safety or good order of the Australian community\".\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision had followed \"careful consideration\".\n\nAlluding to the heavy criticism his government has faced for allowing the unvaccinated player into Australia, Mr Morrison said: \"Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected.\"\n\nvisa, deportation, australia cancels novak djokovic\u2019s visa, australia news, djokovic visa,Australia, Novak Djokovic,Nine News Australia, Australian News, Latest news Australia, covid exemption, australia travel, visa cancelled,Australia, sports, Novak Djokovic, Novak Djokovic vaccine, Novak Djokovic visa,"

                "description": "Novak Djokovic was hauled in front of another Appeals Hearing in the wonderful, not fallen country of Australia to stay and do them a favor by competing in the Aussie Open. Well, unfortunately, that exemption he was granted, then had revoked, then reinstated again, was revoked again. France followed suit by announcing that the French Open, IN MAY, would have similar \"temporary regulations\" to disallow anyone without the jab... or whatever number of jabs they deem necessary by that time: 5 or 6?\n\nThe Australian Government/Empire may have considered this a big win, but in actuality, they turned one of the world's premier athletes, into a martyr. We will see if he decided to take up the mantle.\n\nAlso, Nikki Fried called Ron DeSantis \"literally Hitler,\" because Democrats are out of ideas.

                    "description": "Novak Djokovic was hauled in front of another Appeals Hearing in the wonderful, not fallen country of Australia to stay and do them a favor by competing in the Aussie Open. Well, unfortunately, that exemption he was granted, then had revoked, then reinstated again, was revoked again. France followed suit by announcing that the French Open, IN MAY, would have similar \"temporary regulations\" to disallow anyone without the jab... or whatever number of jabs they deem necessary by that time: 5 or 6?\n\nThe Australian Government/Empire may have considered this a big win, but in actuality, they turned one of the world's premier athletes, into a martyr. We will see if he decided to take up the mantle.\n\nAlso, Nikki Fried called Ron DeSantis \"literally Hitler,\" because Democrats are out of ideas. More at 11.\n\nSources:\nThe Epoch Times 1: https://www.theepochtimes.com/djokovic-loses-court-challenge-to-overturn-revoked-visa_4216159.html\nET2: https://www.theepochtimes.com/djokovic-ejection-sets-dangerous-precedent-around-free-speech-australian-legal-groups_4217142.html\nET3: https://www.theepochtimes.com/french-tennis-federation-working-on-welcoming-unvaccinated-foreign-athletes-ahead-of-french-open-in-may_4217579.html\nET4: https://www.theepochtimes.com/group-calls-on-florida-democrat-to-resign-over-comparison-of-desantis-to-hitler_4218332.html\n\nSubscribe to My Fitness/Nutrition/Mindset Channel DKS's 52 Fitness: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzaLZalDUKEe_I7Ot-me68Q\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/DonKhanSwaylo\nFollow DKS on Parler: http://www.parler.com/profile/donkhanswaylo\nSubscribe on Rumble: https://www.rumble.com/donkhanswaylo\nSubscribe on Odysee/LBRY: http://www.odysee.com/@DonKhanSwaylo:5\nFollow DKS on Gab: http://www.gab.com/donkhanswaylo\n#NovakDjokovic #Australia #Tennis"
