                "description": "Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic asked an Australian court to block his deportation after the government canceled his visa for the second time on Friday.\n\nDjokovic's legal team made the request shortly after Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke canceled his visa. Hawke said his decision was based on \u201chealth and good order grounds,\u201d adding \u201cthat it was in the public interest to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Serbian legal team called the decision \u201cirrational.\u201d They said Hawke had argued that permitting Djokovic to stay would incite anti-vaccination feelings in the country. Djokovic has publicly opposed the vaccine requirement. And he had received a medical pardon, or exemption, from vaccination to enter Australia.\n\nAt an emergency hearing late Friday, an Australian judge ruled that Djokovic cannot be deported while the case is being heard. If Djokovic was deported, he could face a three-year ban from entering the country.\n\nHearings for the case will be held over the weekend just before the start of the Australian Open on January 17.\n\nThe world\u2019s top tennis player is looking to win a record 21st Grand Slam championship at the Australian Open. He is currently in a three-way tie for Grand Slam wins with Spain\u2019s Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer of Switzerland.\n\nDjokovic has won the last three Australian tournaments played in Melbourne. He is the favorite to win this year\u2019s championship and is to play against another Serbian player on opening day.\n\nEveryone at the Australian Open \u2014 including players, their support teams, and fans \u2014 is required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Djokovic is not vaccinated and had sought a medical exemption on the grounds that he had COVID-19 on December 16.\n\nThat exemption was approved by the Victoria state government and Tennis Australia. But the Australian Border Force rejected the exemption and canceled his visa when he landed in Melbourne on January 5. A judge then overturned the decision, saying Djokovic had not been given enough time to work with his legal team.\n\nOn Wednesday, Djokovic admitted that he made an \u201cerror\u201d when he did not isolate after getting the coronavirus disease. Around that time, he attended a tennis event with children in Belgrade without wearing a face covering and met with reporters from the French newspapers L'Equipe.\n\nHe also blamed his support team for providing incorrect information on his visa documents. In his visa request, Djokovic declared that he had not traveled anywhere in the 14 days before his arrival in Australia. But Djokovic, who lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco, was seen in public in Spain and Serbia during that period.\n\nGreek Stefanos Tsitsipas is the world\u2019s number fourth male player. He said before Hawke's decision that Djokovic was \"playing by his own rules\" and making vaccinated players \"look like fools.\"\n\nThe Association of Tennis Professionals says 97 of the top 100 male players in the world are vaccinated. And, Tennys Sandgren, the world\u2019s number 93 player could not take part in the Australian Open because he did not meet the two-shot vaccination requirement.\n\nBritish star Andy Murray has played against Djokovic for many years. He told reporters that the situation was \"not great for the tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novak\".\n\nMany Australians are angered that Djokovic has been exempted from vaccination so he can play in the Australian Open.\n\nAustralia has spent more time in lockdown than any other country. Currently, there are a record number of COVID cases in Australia. And an online poll by the News Corp media group found that 83 percent favored deportation for Djokovic.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison praised the decision to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa. He said, \"Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected.\u201d\n\n--------------------------------------\nThank you for watching.

Djokovic had been infected with the virus in December. \n\nHowever, his visa was canceled when he arrived at Melbourne airport January 5 by Border Force officials, who said he had flouted immigration rules. \n\nHe was sent to an immigration detention hotel in Melbourne. \n\nHis visa was reinstated by an Australian judge on Monday, but it was revoked for a second time by immigration minister Alex Hawke on Friday. \n\nDjokovic is not inoculated against COVID-19 and Hawke asserted that his presence in Australia would stir anti-vaccination sentiment and canceled his visa on health and public interest grounds. \n\nThe tennis champion\u2019s lawyers insisted the government\u2019s argument was irrational and illogical. The three federal court judges unanimously disagreed, and Djokovic\u2019s appeal Sunday was dismissed. \n\nDjokovic has won the Australian Open title nine times. \n\nBefore he left Australia, he said in a statement that he was \u201cextremely disappointed with the Court ruling\u201d but he respected the decision and would \u201ccooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country.\u201d \n\nhttps://www.voanews.com/a/australian-court-novak-djokovic-vaccine/6398859.html",
