                "description": "Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declared tennis champion Novak Djokovic is solely to blame for his visa cancellation and deportation from Australia after failing to brandish proof to Border Force authorities.\n\n \"Ultimately, this is the responsibility of the traveller. It is for the traveller to be able to assert and backup their ability to come into the country consistent with our laws,\" Mr Morrison told a media conference on Thursday.\n\n\"It is simply a matter of following the rules.\"\n\nMr Morrison said the onus of responsibility fell on Djokovic's shoulders to provide proof of his vaccination status to authorities.\n\n\"It is on them to have the proof to show why they would not have to be vaccinated. He was unable to furnish that proof to Border Force offices at the airport last night and they are the rules,\" he said.\n\nDjokovic had been held at Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine Airport upon landing late last night after a visa bungle \u2013 where it is reported his team failed to apply for a visa which allowed for vaccination exemption.\n\nHe is believed to have been relying on the fact he had COVID within the past six months and was granted approval to compete by Tennis Australia yesterday.\n\nThe nine-time Australian Open champion was subsequently told his visa had been rejected and that he would be flown out of Australia today.",

                    "description": "Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declared tennis champion Novak Djokovic is solely to blame for his visa cancellation and deportation from Australia after failing to brandish proof to Border Force authorities.\n\n \"Ultimately, this is the responsibility of the traveller. It is for the traveller to be able to assert and backup their ability to come into the country consistent with our laws,\" Mr Morrison told a media conference on Thursday.\n\n\"It is simply a matter of following the rules.\"\n\nMr Morrison said the onus of responsibility fell on Djokovic's shoulders to provide proof of his vaccination status to authorities.\n\n\"It is on them to have the proof to show why they would not have to be vaccinated. He was unable to furnish that proof to Border Force offices at the airport last night and they are the rules,\" he said.\n\nDjokovic had been held at Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine Airport upon landing late last night after a visa bungle \u2013 where it is reported his team failed to apply for a visa which allowed for vaccination exemption.\n\nHe is believed to have been relying on the fact he had COVID within the past six months and was granted approval to compete by Tennis Australia yesterday.\n\nThe nine-time Australian Open champion was subsequently told his visa had been rejected and that he would be flown out of Australia today."

                "title": "Novak Djokovic situation explained World No  1 deported a day before 2022",
                "description": "Novak Djokovic, the world's No. 1-ranked men's tennis player, looked to be a go for the Australian Open after his visa was reinstated Monday. But those hopes faded once Djokovic's visa was canceled a second time on Friday, and they evaporated after the 34-year-old was deported after his appeal failed on Sunday. Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke was responsible for Djokovic's newest visa cancellation, and he said his decision serves the \"public interest. \" Djokovic, who's unvaccinated against COVID-19, failed to acquire a proper medical exemption ahead of his flight to Australia and listed inaccurate information in his travel declaration form. Djokovic's lawyers began an appeal to reverse Hawke's decision, but a three-judge panel unanimously ruled in favor of it on Sunday. in their ruling, the judges said Djokovic's presence \"may be counterproductive to efforts at vaccination by others in Australia. \"The deportation of Djokovic ended his brief but chaotic stay in the country. Djokovic revealed Tuesday night he conducted an interview with the French newspaper L'Equipe last month after testing positive for COVID-19. The tennis star also acknowledged his travel declaration form contained falsehoods about his whereabouts the 14 days preceding his flight to Australia. On Monday, Federal Circuit Court Judge Anthony Kelly ruled Djokovic could stay in Australia after he spent four days quarantining in a Melbourne hotel. The Australian Open listed Djokovic as a No. 1 seed the following day. Djokovic celebrated the judge's ruling on Twitter, but Friday's news proved the celebration was premature. Hawke's decision could not only keep Djokovic from the 2022 Australian Open but also ban him from the country for three years. For four days, Djokovic\u00a0remained under Australian Border Force (ABF) watch\u00a0while awaiting the ruling on his visa. The 20-time Grand Slam winner attempted to enter Australia with a COVID-19 vaccine medical exemption for the Australian Open. But a court is deciding whether that tournament exemption applies to the country as well. Since 2020, Djokovic has repeatedly refused to publicly divulge his vaccination status and once said he was \"opposed\" to vaccinations entirely. The Australian Open instituted a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all players on Nov. 19, and Djokovic announced he received a medical exemption to compete in the event on Jan. 4. But after flying into the Melbourne airport on Jan. 5, ABF detained Djokovic and attempted to deport him. ABF didn't get clearance then, but Djokovic eventually made his way out the country on Sunday. Now, Djokovic will not get a chance to win a record 21st Grand Slam title at the 2022 Australian Open. He's currently tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most ever singles titles with 20. Here's everything you need to know about his situation, beginning with the latest news:Djokovic's tumultuous stay in Australia has reached its end.\n\n\nAll data is taken from the source: http://cbssports.com\nArticle Link: https://www.cbssports.com/tennis/news/novak-djokovic-situation-explained-world-no-1-deported-one-day-before-australian-open-after-failed-appeal/\n\n\n#djokovic #newsoftheday #newsworldbbc #cnnnewstoday #usanewstoday #newsworldabc #",

For four days, Djokovic\u00a0remained under Australian Border Force (ABF) watch\u00a0while awaiting the ruling on his visa. The 20-time Grand Slam winner attempted to enter Australia with a COVID-19 vaccine medical exemption for the Australian Open. But a court is deciding whether that tournament exemption applies to the country as well. Since 2020, Djokovic has repeatedly refused to publicly divulge his vaccination status and once said he was \"opposed\" to vaccinations entirely. The Australian Open instituted a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all players on Nov. 19, and Djokovic announced he received a medical exemption to compete in the event on Jan. 4. But after flying into the Melbourne airport on Jan. 5, ABF detained Djokovic and attempted to deport him. ABF didn't get clearance then, but Djokovic eventually made his way out the country on Sunday. Now, Djokovic will not get a chance to win a record 21st Grand Slam title at the 2022 Australian Open. He's currently tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most ever singles titles with 20. Here's everything you need to know about his situation, beginning with the latest news:Djokovic's tumultuous stay in Australia has reached its end.\n\n\nAll data is taken from the source: http://cbssports.com\nArticle Link: https://www.cbssports.com/tennis/news/novak-djokovic-situation-explained-world-no-1-deported-one-day-before-australian-open-after-failed-appeal/\n\n\n#djokovic #newsoftheday #newsworldbbc #cnnnewstoday #usanewstoday #newsworldabc #"
