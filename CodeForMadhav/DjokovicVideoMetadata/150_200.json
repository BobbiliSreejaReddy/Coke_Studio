                "title": "Novak Djokovic deported after legal battle loss; French Open in doubt",
                "description": "Update (Jan. 17, 2022): Tennis star Novak Djokovic returned to his home country of Serbia Monday after his legal battle to compete in the Australian Open ended in deportation. He had his visa pulled twice while in Australia for being unvaccinated, and an appeal to stay in the country failed over the weekend.\n\nRate this story: https://santv.co/3JUBTxU.\n\n\u201cThis cancellation decision was made on health, safety and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement in response to the weekend ruling. \u201cI welcome the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe.\u201d\n\nNot only is Djokovic not competing at the Australian Open; he may not be able to compete at the French Open either. A new law passed in France that excludes unvaccinated people from sports venues, restaurants and other public places will apply to anyone who wants to play in the French Open. There was originally supposed to be a bubble around the tournament where unvaccinated could compete. The French Open is set to start in late May.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 14, 2022): Tennis star Novak Djokovic has to fight another legal battle to stay in Australia after officials canceled his visa for the second time in just over a week on Friday. Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said he used his ministerial discretion to cancel the visa on public interest grounds.\n\n\u201cAustralians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement commenting on the decision. \u201cThis is what the Minister is doing in taking this action today.\u201d\n\nDjokovic would remain free on Friday night, but would effectively return to immigration detention when he meets with Australian Border Force officials at 8 a.m. Saturday. He doesn\u2019t have much time to get the decision reversed, with the Australian Open set to begin Monday. His lawyer Nick Wood told Judge Anthony Kelly, the same one who ruled in favor of Djokovic earlier this week, that Wood hopes an appeal would be heard Sunday.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 13, 2022): Three days after tennis star Novak Djokovic won a major legal battle in Australia, he was given the top seed in the upcoming Australian Open on Thursday. The tournament begins Monday.\n\nThursday\u2019s move comes as it is still unclear whether Djokovic will be allowed to remain in the country for the tournament. Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke has been considering whether or not to allow Djokovic to stay since a judge ruled he could on Monday.\n\nExpectations of a pending decision were raised when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called a news conference after a national Cabinet meeting Thursday. That speculation heightened when the tournament draw was postponed by 75 minutes, so it could happen after Morrison\u2019s news conference. However that news conference did not address the Djokovic situation, with Morrison referring questions on Djokovic to Hawke.\n\n\u201cThese are personal ministerial powers able to be exercised by Minister Hawke and I don\u2019t propose to make any further comment at this time,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nFollow Straight Arrow News on social media \u2014\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/straightarrownews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/StraightArrow__\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/straightarrownews/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@straightarrownews",

                    "description": "Update (Jan. 17, 2022): Tennis star Novak Djokovic returned to his home country of Serbia Monday after his legal battle to compete in the Australian Open ended in deportation. He had his visa pulled twice while in Australia for being unvaccinated, and an appeal to stay in the country failed over the weekend.\n\nRate this story: https://santv.co/3JUBTxU.\n\n\u201cThis cancellation decision was made on health, safety and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement in response to the weekend ruling. \u201cI welcome the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe.\u201d\n\nNot only is Djokovic not competing at the Australian Open; he may not be able to compete at the French Open either. A new law passed in France that excludes unvaccinated people from sports venues, restaurants and other public places will apply to anyone who wants to play in the French Open. There was originally supposed to be a bubble around the tournament where unvaccinated could compete. The French Open is set to start in late May.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 14, 2022): Tennis star Novak Djokovic has to fight another legal battle to stay in Australia after officials canceled his visa for the second time in just over a week on Friday. Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said he used his ministerial discretion to cancel the visa on public interest grounds.\n\n\u201cAustralians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement commenting on the decision. \u201cThis is what the Minister is doing in taking this action today.\u201d\n\nDjokovic would remain free on Friday night, but would effectively return to immigration detention when he meets with Australian Border Force officials at 8 a.m. Saturday. He doesn\u2019t have much time to get the decision reversed, with the Australian Open set to begin Monday. His lawyer Nick Wood told Judge Anthony Kelly, the same one who ruled in favor of Djokovic earlier this week, that Wood hopes an appeal would be heard Sunday.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 13, 2022): Three days after tennis star Novak Djokovic won a major legal battle in Australia, he was given the top seed in the upcoming Australian Open on Thursday. The tournament begins Monday.\n\nThursday\u2019s move comes as it is still unclear whether Djokovic will be allowed to remain in the country for the tournament. Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke has been considering whether or not to allow Djokovic to stay since a judge ruled he could on Monday.\n\nExpectations of a pending decision were raised when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called a news conference after a national Cabinet meeting Thursday. That speculation heightened when the tournament draw was postponed by 75 minutes, so it could happen after Morrison\u2019s news conference. However that news conference did not address the Djokovic situation, with Morrison referring questions on Djokovic to Hawke.\n\n\u201cThese are personal ministerial powers able to be exercised by Minister Hawke and I don\u2019t propose to make any further comment at this time,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nFollow Straight Arrow News on social media \u2014\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/straightarrownews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/StraightArrow__\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/straightarrownews/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@straightarrownews"
