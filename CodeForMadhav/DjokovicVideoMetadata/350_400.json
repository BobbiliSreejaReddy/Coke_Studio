The vaccine-sceptic Serb was stopped by border officials on arrival to Australia late on Wednesday and denied entry into the country.  He is currently being held at an immigration detention facility in Melbourne and faces deportation.\n\nDjokovic had flown into the city's Tullamarine Airport expecting to defend his Australian Open crown, and to bid for an unprecedented 21st Grand Slam title.\n\nHe had claimed on Instagram that he had obtained an exemption to play in the tournament, which begins on January 17, without being vaccinated.\nhttps://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/novak-djokovic-to-pursue-legal-action-after-australia-cancels-visa-report-2691787 #News Shorts\n#short news",

The vaccine-sceptic Serb was stopped by border officials on arrival to Australia late on Wednesday and denied entry into the country.  He is currently being held at an immigration detention facility in Melbourne and faces deportation.\n\nDjokovic had flown into the city's Tullamarine Airport expecting to defend his Australian Open crown, and to bid for an unprecedented 21st Grand Slam title.\n\nHe had claimed on Instagram that he had obtained an exemption to play in the tournament, which begins on January 17, without being vaccinated.\nhttps://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/novak-djokovic-to-pursue-legal-action-after-australia-cancels-visa-report-2691787 #News Shorts\n#short news"

Djokovic is the defending champion and has won the Australian Open men's singles title nine times.\nHe has 20 Grand Slam singles title, a men's record he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.",

                    "description": "Tennis star Novak Djokovic on Sunday remained confined to an immigration detention hotel in Melbourne, where he's been preparing a legal challenge against his visa cancellation in the Federal Circuit Court.\nDjokovic's lawyers have filed court papers in his challenge against deportation from Australia that show he tested positive for COVID-19 last month and recovered, grounds he used in applying for a medical exemption to the country's strict vaccination rules.\nThe world number one was denied entry at Melbourne airport late Wednesday after border officials canceled his visa for failing to meet its entry requirement that all non-citizens be fully vaccinated for COVID-19.\nDjokovic was given a medical exemption backed by the Victoria state government and Australian Open organizers on January 1, based on information he supplied to two independent medical panels, and he was approved for a visa electronically.\nBut it has since emerged that the Victoria state medical exemption, allowed for people who tested positive for the coronavirus within the last six months, was deemed invalid by the federal border authorities.\nThe Australian Open starts January 17. Djokovic is the defending champion and has won the Australian Open men's singles title nine times.\nHe has 20 Grand Slam singles title, a men's record he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal."
