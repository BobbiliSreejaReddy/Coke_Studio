The 19 year old wildcard went for his shots again. showing no fear as he went toe to toe with the Serbian champion. But Djokovic was too good winning 6 3 6 3 in 73 minutes to advance to a meeting with Australian Alex de Minaur or Russian Karen Khachanov in the second round. Djokovic said he was a little rusty at times but 'that is to be expected'. and he 'very much enjoyed' being in front of a crowd again. 'It's been a while since I played the last match and I couldn't pick a better place to kick start the season.' he said in his on court post match interview. 'All in all it was a very pleasant experience for me.' Djokovic had been cheered onto court and had plenty of support under the lights with some spectators waving flags bearing his likeness and the slogan 'Stand with Novak'. The five time champion in Dubai had no problems getting into the United Arab Emirates despite being the only player in the men's top 100 unvaccinated against COVID 19. The jab is not required for visitors to Dubai. He was deported from Australia on 16 January on 'health and good order grounds' after a protracted legal battle with the federal government. Djokovic said at the weekend he felt 'as well prepared as I possibly can be' and so it proved against world No.58 Musetti. The 34 year old Djokovic   who last week said in a BBC he was not against vaccines but was prepared to miss major tournaments rather than receive a COVID 19 vaccination   said he was well received by his fellow players in Dubai. 'Majority of them actually welcomed me and said it's nice to see me back on the tour.' he said. 'That makes me feel great.'\r\n\r\n#news",
