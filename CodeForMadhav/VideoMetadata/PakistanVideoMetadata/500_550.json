The signature Kaavish sound is etched onto every microtone of the arrangement with Jaffer Zaidi\u2019s sonorous, melancholic vocals and Maaz Maudood\u2019s soul-stirring guitar tones. Alongside the duo, shining through the musical landscape of the song, Quratulain Balouch uncovers previously unchartered territory as her textured, emotive vocals seasons the song into one of the sweetest manifestation of heartbreak and loss. Floating on a cushion of warm, layered keys and nostalgic backing vocals, Faasle is an ode to love found and love lost. \n\nHOUSEBAND\nImran Akhoond (Guitars)\nAahad Nayani (Drums)\nKamran \u2018Mannu' Zafar (Bass)\nHaider Ali (Keyboards/Piano)\nOmran Shafique (Guitars)\nAbdul Aziz Kazi (Percussions)\n\nBACKING VOCALISTS\nRachel Viccaji\nShahab Hussain\nNatasha Khan\n\nSTRINGS SECTION\nJaved Iqbal (First Violinist)\nGhulam Abbas\nGhulam Muhammad\nMuhammad Ilyas\nBabar Ali\nKhawar Hussain\n\nGUEST MUSICIAN\nJoshua Keyth Benjamin (Keys)",

The signature Kaavish sound is etched onto every microtone of the arrangement with Jaffer Zaidi\u2019s sonorous, melancholic vocals and Maaz Maudood\u2019s soul-stirring guitar tones. Alongside the duo, shining through the musical landscape of the song, Quratulain Balouch uncovers previously unchartered territory as her textured, emotive vocals seasons the song into one of the sweetest manifestation of heartbreak and loss. Floating on a cushion of warm, layered keys and nostalgic backing vocals, Faasle is an ode to love found and love lost. \n\nHOUSEBAND\nImran Akhoond (Guitars)\nAahad Nayani (Drums)\nKamran \u2018Mannu' Zafar (Bass)\nHaider Ali (Keyboards/Piano)\nOmran Shafique (Guitars)\nAbdul Aziz Kazi (Percussions)\n\nBACKING VOCALISTS\nRachel Viccaji\nShahab Hussain\nNatasha Khan\n\nSTRINGS SECTION\nJaved Iqbal (First Violinist)\nGhulam Abbas\nGhulam Muhammad\nMuhammad Ilyas\nBabar Ali\nKhawar Hussain\n\nGUEST MUSICIAN\nJoshua Keyth Benjamin (Keys)"

Written, composed and performed by Noori \u2013 the tune has stayed in the duo\u2019s vault with some hundred odd unreleased tracks with Ali Hamza playing with this one for a good 8 years. \u2018O Re\u2019 is crammed full of energetic lively antics from the accordion solo adding a celebratory atmosphere to the soft alluring vocals, or the infectious chorus to impeccable guitar skills spewing from Ali Noor.

Written, composed and performed by Noori \u2013 the tune has stayed in the duo\u2019s vault with some hundred odd unreleased tracks with Ali Hamza playing with this one for a good 8 years. \u2018O Re\u2019 is crammed full of energetic lively antics from the accordion solo adding a celebratory atmosphere to the soft alluring vocals, or the infectious chorus to impeccable guitar skills spewing from Ali Noor. The love-drenched single might be a rare release but the kind that won\u2019t leave your mind long after you\u2019ve asked it to. #CokeStudio9"

Taking the reigns from the beginning, the single opens with QB holding her own in a track that is impeccably designed around her voice, as the brooding and effective bass guitar riff makes way for a complete change in tempo. Through its energetic music structure \u2013 Shuja\u2019s strong, melodic vocal abilities \u2013 the constant shifting of the pace makes the journey through the track unpredictably wonderful. #CokeStudio9"

That is until in a split second the track pauses before a psychedelic riff transforms the original arrangement of the track, and the vocals of Basit Ali cut through distinctive and strong. Written by \nAsad Muhammad Khan and originally composed by Ashiq Ali, the overhauled duet has a renewed edge comprising an upbeat drumbeat, fuzzy guitar twangs, a brilliant sitar solo \u2013 adeptly delivering a tune with a powerful soul comprising a timeless, moving melody. #CokeStudio9",

That is until in a split second the track pauses before a psychedelic riff transforms the original arrangement of the track, and the vocals of Basit Ali cut through distinctive and strong. Written by \nAsad Muhammad Khan and originally composed by Ashiq Ali, the overhauled duet has a renewed edge comprising an upbeat drumbeat, fuzzy guitar twangs, a brilliant sitar solo \u2013 adeptly delivering a tune with a powerful soul comprising a timeless, moving melody. #CokeStudio9"

The romantic ballads, both originally sung by Shuja Haider, features him as the music director, calling the shots in a track that truly delivers from the heart. The soft piano and the subtle sound of the sitar create a fitting atmosphere for Momina\u2019s soft vocals, sung with utmost grace, as Asim croons over cinematic violins about the love story, packed full of emotions. Midway through the duration, as the track gathers momentum, it brings together elements of the Pakistani pop scene of the bygone era, and takes you to a dreamy place whilst celebrating romance and leaving one smitten. #CokeStudio9",

With a bracing blend of swift guitar, the track opens in an intimate atmosphere as Shahzad Nawaz makes a guest appearance narrating words by Bulleh Shah at intervals. In the original composition by Faakhir Mehmood, and additional lyrics by Sabir Zafar and Javed Bashir, this sufi-style rendition builds into something with much more energy, spirit and life. The high-pitched vocals of Javed and the deep tones of Masooma, strikingly fuse with an unstoppable groove, a bouncing chorus and a flickering drumbeat. #CokeStudio9",

Powerful and emotive, the track screams music directors Noori\u2019s signature style \u2013 awash with pounding drums and warped guitars, masterfully blending into one another. The teamwork went beyond lending the voices; the duo struck a balance by spending several days confined in a studio working on the melody and the lyrics. Junaid\u2019s hushed chest voice and perfect falsetto puts the expressivity of Momina\u2019s vocals at the forefront of the track featuring a guitar solo by her that helps bring the song\u2019s explosive personality to life. #CokeStudio9",

Powerful and emotive, the track screams music directors Noori\u2019s signature style \u2013 awash with pounding drums and warped guitars, masterfully blending into one another. The teamwork went beyond lending the voices; the duo struck a balance by spending several days confined in a studio working on the melody and the lyrics. Junaid\u2019s hushed chest voice and perfect falsetto puts the expressivity of Momina\u2019s vocals at the forefront of the track featuring a guitar solo by her that helps bring the song\u2019s explosive personality to life. #CokeStudio9"
