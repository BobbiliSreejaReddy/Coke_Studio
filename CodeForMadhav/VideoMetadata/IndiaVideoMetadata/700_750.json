                "description": "This song is about the legendary star crossed lovers, Sassi & Punnu. They live in separate villages on two sides of a mountain, i.e. the dungar. Sassi then sings to the dungar to ensure there are no obstacles in her path as she wants to cross over right away & is dying to meet her lover. Through this song, Clinton almost magically marries two very different styles of music, i.e. Sawan Khan and the Gospel Choir. In fact, Clinton uses a 31-piece choir to give this song a genuine Gospel vibe.\n\nFind the lyrics at http://www.cokestudioindia.com/season2/episode1.html?WT.cl=1&WT.mn=Episode%201\n\nCredits:\n\nLanguage: Sindhi & English\nComposer: Sindhi --Traditional, English parts composed by Clinton Cerejo\nProducer: Clinton Cerejo\nVocals: Sawan Khan Manganiyar\nLyrics: Sindhi Lyrics-Traditional, English Lyrics -- Adapted from Psalm 61\nChoir: The Salvation Singers conducted by Dylan D'souza\nKeys: Beven Fonseca\nKeys: Aman Mahajan\nKeys: Clinton Cerejo\nDrums: Lindsay D'Mello\nAcoustic Guitar: Shon Pinto\nElectric Guitar: NyzelD'Lima\nBass: Rushad Mistry\nIndian Percussion: Aslam Dafrani,\nIndian Percussion: Haneef Dafrani\nBacking Vocals: Lynn D'souza\nBacking Vocals: Thomson Andrews\nBacking Vocals: Dwayne Leroy Gamree\nBacking Vocals: Crystal Sequeira\nRecorded by: Steve Fitzmaurice, Ashish Manchanda (Flying Carpet Productions, Mumbai), assisted by Thorsten Muller\nMixed by Steve Fitzmaurice at the Pierce Rooms, London\nMastered by Bunt Stafford Clark at the Pierce Rooms, London.\n\nSong Synopsis: \nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you,\nCall as my heart grows faint,\nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed,\nLead me, Lead me, lead me to the rock,\nLead me, lead me, lead me to the rock that is higher than I,\nHigher than I, higher than I,\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya.\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\nDungar Dukh na de,\n\nHear my cry,\nhear my voice, lift me up,\nI call to you,\nLord, In your house I long to dwell, in your presence I sing\n\nChad da si jabbal chot te, Bhalom jaani Khan miya\nChad da si jabbal chot te, Sassi saathan ke bai saade\nAdda de\nsaathan ke bai saade\nAdaa De\nPand pachadi aaya.\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\nBhalo miya\nDungar Dukh na de,\n\nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you,\nLong as my heart goes free,\nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed,\nLead me, Lead me, lead me to the rock,\nLead me, lead me, lead me to the rock that is higher than I,\n\nLaaloon Laal lafit je, Bhalom jaani Khan miya\nLaaloon Laal lafit je, Chakhaviya Hiit Chade\nAdda De\nChakhaviya Hiit Chade\nAdda De\nPand pachadi aaya\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\nBhalo Miya adda\nDungar Dukh na de,\n\nO miya,\n\nMeaning:\n\nThe song is a beautiful amalgamation of spiritual love with that of the earthly love legends of Sassi and\nPunnu, a tragic folktale of unfulfilled romantic destiny of \"Sassi\", a daughter of a king of Bhamboor (who\nwas abandoned right after birth by her parents, but was later found and adopted by a washer man of\nthis same village) and \"Punnu\", who was the son of king from Baluchistan.\n\nPoet says just as Sassi called for her love from one end of the mountain that separated the two\ncalled \"Dungar\" to reach out to her husband and love Punnu, after they were separated right after their\nmarriage, I call you, my lord, from this earth, as I am awake and have tasted the pleasure of your love. I\nimplore you to take my soul to a higher plane...for I am tired of this petty existence and the pain of this\nseparation from you. I long to live in your peaceful abode and sing in your praise.\n\nThe Poet says I have seen the world and its devious ways, I want to take the journey to you, no matter\nhow tough it is, just as Sassi undertook the arduous journey from one end of the village to the other\nand walked for miles before she breathed her last in her pursuit of love. All I request is for you to help\nensure that no obstacle ever hampers my journey to you...my Lord...my love.",

In fact, Clinton uses a 31-piece choir to give this song a genuine Gospel vibe.\n\nFind the lyrics at http://www.cokestudioindia.com/season2/episode1.html?WT.cl=1&WT.mn=Episode%201\n\nCredits:\n\nLanguage: Sindhi & English\nComposer: Sindhi --Traditional, English parts composed by Clinton Cerejo\nProducer: Clinton Cerejo\nVocals: Sawan Khan Manganiyar\nLyrics: Sindhi Lyrics-Traditional, English Lyrics -- Adapted from Psalm 61\nChoir: The Salvation Singers conducted by Dylan D'souza\nKeys: Beven Fonseca\nKeys: Aman Mahajan\nKeys: Clinton Cerejo\nDrums: Lindsay D'Mello\nAcoustic Guitar: Shon Pinto\nElectric Guitar: NyzelD'Lima\nBass: Rushad Mistry\nIndian Percussion: Aslam Dafrani,\nIndian Percussion: Haneef Dafrani\nBacking Vocals: Lynn D'souza\nBacking Vocals: Thomson Andrews\nBacking Vocals: Dwayne Leroy Gamree\nBacking Vocals: Crystal Sequeira\nRecorded by: Steve Fitzmaurice, Ashish Manchanda (Flying Carpet Productions, Mumbai), assisted by Thorsten Muller\nMixed by Steve Fitzmaurice at the Pierce Rooms, London\nMastered by Bunt Stafford Clark at the Pierce Rooms, London.\n\nSong Synopsis: \nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you,\nCall as my heart grows faint,\nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed,\nLead me, Lead me, lead me to the rock,\nLead me, lead me, lead me to the rock that is higher than I,\nHigher than I, higher than I,\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya.\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\nDungar Dukh na de,\n\nHear my cry,\nhear my voice, lift me up,\nI call to you,\nLord, In your house I long to dwell, in your presence I sing\n\nChad da si jabbal chot te, Bhalom jaani Khan miya\nChad da si jabbal chot te, Sassi saathan ke bai saade\nAdda de\nsaathan ke bai saade\nAdaa De\nPand pachadi aaya.\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\nBhalo miya\nDungar Dukh na de,\n\nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you,\nLong as my heart goes free,\nFrom the ends of the earth I call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed,\nLead me, Lead me, lead me to the rock,\nLead me, lead me, lead me to the rock that is higher than I,\n\nLaaloon Laal lafit je, Bhalom jaani Khan miya\nLaaloon Laal lafit je, Chakhaviya Hiit Chade\nAdda De\nChakhaviya Hiit Chade\nAdda De\nPand pachadi aaya\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\n\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nDungar Dukh na de,\nAdaa de,\nPand pachadi aaya\nBhalo Miya adda\nDungar Dukh na de,\n\nO miya,\n\nMeaning:\n\nThe song is a beautiful amalgamation of spiritual love with that of the earthly love legends of Sassi and\nPunnu, a tragic folktale of unfulfilled romantic destiny of \"Sassi\", a daughter of a king of Bhamboor (who\nwas abandoned right after birth by her parents, but was later found and adopted by a washer man of\nthis same village) and \"Punnu\", who was the son of king from Baluchistan.\n\nPoet says just as Sassi called for her love from one end of the mountain that separated the two\ncalled \"Dungar\" to reach out to her husband and love Punnu, after they were separated right after their\nmarriage, I call you, my lord, from this earth, as I am awake and have tasted the pleasure of your love. I\nimplore you to take my soul to a higher plane...for I am tired of this petty existence and the pain of this\nseparation from you. I long to live in your peaceful abode and sing in your praise.\n\nThe Poet says I have seen the world and its devious ways, I want to take the journey to you, no matter\nhow tough it is, just as Sassi undertook the arduous journey from one end of the village to the other\nand walked for miles before she breathed her last in her pursuit of love. All I request is for you to help\nensure that no obstacle ever hampers my journey to you...my Lord...my love."

                "description": "An introspective song, Chaddh De flows like a river. The song is about letting go of desires. It talks about how futile it is to fret over desires or wants when your time on earth is limited. It's about the futility of trying to control life when everybody's place is preordained and nothing one does can ever change that. \nIt was written by Lyricist Manoj during a low & depressive phase of his life. The lyrics literally mean 'oh fool let go' (of your desires). Clinton includes a remarkable string section in this song with the cello playing a prominent role.\n\nFind the lyrics at http://www.cokestudioindia.com/season2/episode1.html?WT.cl=1&WT.mn=Episode%201\n\nCredits:\n\nLanguage: Hindi\nComposer: Clinton Cerejo\nProducer: Clinton Cerejo\nVocals: Master Saleem\nLyrics: Traditional Lyrics and Hindi Lyrics by Manoj Yadav\nCello Soloist: Jake Charkey\nString Section: Jitendra Thakur & strings\nKeys: Beven Fonseca\nKeys: Aman Mahajan\nDrums: Lindsay D'Mello\nSteel String Guitar: Shon Pinto\nNylon String Guitar and E- Bow Electric Lead: NyzelD'Lima\nSteel String Guitar: Clinton Cerejo\nBass: Rushad Mistry\nIndian Percussion: Aslam Dafrani\nIndian Percussion: Haneef Dafrani\nBacking Vocals: Lynn D'souza\nBacking Vocals: Thomson Andrews\nBacking Vocals: Dwayne Leroy Gamree\nBacking Vocals: Crystal Sequeira\nRecorded by: Steve Fitzmaurice, Ashish Manchanda (Flying Carpet Productions, Mumbai), assisted by Thorsten Muller\nMixed by Steve Fitzmaurice at the Pierce Rooms, London\nMastered by Bunt Stafford Clark at the Pierce Rooms, London.\n\nSong Synopsis: \nChaddh de murakh moh jagat da, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat da, Chaddh de murakh moh\nJag hai rait Ka teela, Jag hai rait Ka teela,\nKaun leher mein beh jaaye jeevan Ka khaab Kabeela,\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nKyun naape tu raat divas ke kya hai tere paas,\nKyun naape tu raat divas ke kya hai tere paas\nSab chhoteygaa yahan yahin, Sab chhoteygaa yahan yahin\nTu phir kyun paale aas,\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nSabka hissa tay hai jag mein Karle khoob talaash\nSabka hissa tay hai jag mein Karle khoob talaash\nkuch dhuein ki dor banein, kuch dhuein ki dor banein\nAur kuch pe jaamey ghaas\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nJag hai rait Ka teela, Jag hai rait Ka teela,\nKaun leher mein beh jaaye jeevan Ka khaab Kabeela,\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nKabiraa\nKabiraa jab hum aaye jagat mein, jag hanse hum roye,\nAisi Karni Kar chalein, Ke hum hanse jag roye,\n\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nMeaning:\n\nThe Poet is imploring to all beings, to not fall for the worldly traps. For life is like loose sand, that will\nflow away without any warning in the endless wide ocean of impermanence. When we know that the\nend of this journey will have to be done alone and empty handed, what is point of dying for desires and\nplanning for them each day?\n\nThe end is inevitable and hence your space is predefined...for you will, either be burnt to ashes and\nhence become part of the air or, be buried and hence will become part of this earth...one day.\n\nPoet quotes the great Saint and poet, Sant Kabirdas, \"since we know the end is inevitable, we must use\nthis time to sow good deeds. For when we came to this earth as a new born, everyone laughed and we\ncried...but when we undertake our final journey, the world must miss us for the plethora of good that\nwe would have done...while we enjoy our communion with The One\".\n\nDownload this song NOW!\nhttp://www.itunes.com/cokestudio",

                    "description": "An introspective song, Chaddh De flows like a river. The song is about letting go of desires. It talks about how futile it is to fret over desires or wants when your time on earth is limited. It's about the futility of trying to control life when everybody's place is preordained and nothing one does can ever change that. \nIt was written by Lyricist Manoj during a low & depressive phase of his life. The lyrics literally mean 'oh fool let go' (of your desires). Clinton includes a remarkable string section in this song with the cello playing a prominent role.\n\nFind the lyrics at http://www.cokestudioindia.com/season2/episode1.html?WT.cl=1&WT.mn=Episode%201\n\nCredits:\n\nLanguage: Hindi\nComposer: Clinton Cerejo\nProducer: Clinton Cerejo\nVocals: Master Saleem\nLyrics: Traditional Lyrics and Hindi Lyrics by Manoj Yadav\nCello Soloist: Jake Charkey\nString Section: Jitendra Thakur & strings\nKeys: Beven Fonseca\nKeys: Aman Mahajan\nDrums: Lindsay D'Mello\nSteel String Guitar: Shon Pinto\nNylon String Guitar and E- Bow Electric Lead: NyzelD'Lima\nSteel String Guitar: Clinton Cerejo\nBass: Rushad Mistry\nIndian Percussion: Aslam Dafrani\nIndian Percussion: Haneef Dafrani\nBacking Vocals: Lynn D'souza\nBacking Vocals: Thomson Andrews\nBacking Vocals: Dwayne Leroy Gamree\nBacking Vocals: Crystal Sequeira\nRecorded by: Steve Fitzmaurice, Ashish Manchanda (Flying Carpet Productions, Mumbai), assisted by Thorsten Muller\nMixed by Steve Fitzmaurice at the Pierce Rooms, London\nMastered by Bunt Stafford Clark at the Pierce Rooms, London.\n\nSong Synopsis: \nChaddh de murakh moh jagat da, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat da, Chaddh de murakh moh\nJag hai rait Ka teela, Jag hai rait Ka teela,\nKaun leher mein beh jaaye jeevan Ka khaab Kabeela,\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nKyun naape tu raat divas ke kya hai tere paas,\nKyun naape tu raat divas ke kya hai tere paas\nSab chhoteygaa yahan yahin, Sab chhoteygaa yahan yahin\nTu phir kyun paale aas,\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nSabka hissa tay hai jag mein Karle khoob talaash\nSabka hissa tay hai jag mein Karle khoob talaash\nkuch dhuein ki dor banein, kuch dhuein ki dor banein\nAur kuch pe jaamey ghaas\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nJag hai rait Ka teela, Jag hai rait Ka teela,\nKaun leher mein beh jaaye jeevan Ka khaab Kabeela,\nChaddh de, Chaddh de, Chaddh de murakh moh\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nKabiraa\nKabiraa jab hum aaye jagat mein, jag hanse hum roye,\nAisi Karni Kar chalein, Ke hum hanse jag roye,\n\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\nChaddh de murakh moh jagat Da, Chaddh de murakh moh,\n\nMeaning:\n\nThe Poet is imploring to all beings, to not fall for the worldly traps. For life is like loose sand, that will\nflow away without any warning in the endless wide ocean of impermanence. When we know that the\nend of this journey will have to be done alone and empty handed, what is point of dying for desires and\nplanning for them each day?\n\nThe end is inevitable and hence your space is predefined...for you will, either be burnt to ashes and\nhence become part of the air or, be buried and hence will become part of this earth...one day.\n\nPoet quotes the great Saint and poet, Sant Kabirdas, \"since we know the end is inevitable, we must use\nthis time to sow good deeds. For when we came to this earth as a new born, everyone laughed and we\ncried...but when we undertake our final journey, the world must miss us for the plethora of good that\nwe would have done...while we enjoy our communion with The One\".\n\nDownload this song NOW!\nhttp://www.itunes.com/cokestudio"

The\npath is already set, and all we do in life, is create stumbling blocks, that makes the journey\ndifficult.\n\nAt the end of it all if we realize that our bodies are just a mix of elements like earth, water\nand air. And that all the knowledge in the world cannot lead us to the true meaning of life...\nthat the true happiness lies within us. No impermanent vehicle in life can help us sail through\nthe oceans of our existence smoothly, to sail smoothly till the end, it is imperative that we\nsurrender to the Almighty and let him guide our souls. Thinking that we control our destinies\nis foolishness; we can't create or destroy anything, all that happens is a matter of his will.",

The\npath is already set, and all we do in life, is create stumbling blocks, that makes the journey\ndifficult.\n\nAt the end of it all if we realize that our bodies are just a mix of elements like earth, water\nand air. And that all the knowledge in the world cannot lead us to the true meaning of life...\nthat the true happiness lies within us. No impermanent vehicle in life can help us sail through\nthe oceans of our existence smoothly, to sail smoothly till the end, it is imperative that we\nsurrender to the Almighty and let him guide our souls. Thinking that we control our destinies\nis foolishness; we can't create or destroy anything, all that happens is a matter of his will."

For if you fall for the traps of the world, you will lose yourself, but if\nyou stay under his grace, you will reap rich rewards of his kindness.\n\nWhat is the point of getting entangled in the world, when it's all going to end? For the life we\nlive and the air we breathe is all so unpredictable and is a debt we bear. Rather fuel your true\njourney, with prayers, as He only is permanent and most valuable.\n\nWhy waste our precious lives talking to the lesser beings when the same can be used to talk\nto Him. For only prayers for Him is most sensible and meaningful use of your time. Everything\nelse is a lie and so just overcome the myths and discard your mental baggage, as it blocks you\nfrom being one with Him. Whichever soul follows this path, his journey is smooth, like the\nflow of water, and God Himself leads him to the light.\n\nDownload this song NOW!\nhttp://www.itunes.com/cokestudio",

For if you fall for the traps of the world, you will lose yourself, but if\nyou stay under his grace, you will reap rich rewards of his kindness.\n\nWhat is the point of getting entangled in the world, when it's all going to end? For the life we\nlive and the air we breathe is all so unpredictable and is a debt we bear. Rather fuel your true\njourney, with prayers, as He only is permanent and most valuable.\n\nWhy waste our precious lives talking to the lesser beings when the same can be used to talk\nto Him. For only prayers for Him is most sensible and meaningful use of your time. Everything\nelse is a lie and so just overcome the myths and discard your mental baggage, as it blocks you\nfrom being one with Him. Whichever soul follows this path, his journey is smooth, like the\nflow of water, and God Himself leads him to the light.\n\nDownload this song NOW!\nhttp://www.itunes.com/cokestudio"
