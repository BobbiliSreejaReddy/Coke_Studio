Cos human still can breath using one lungs after another compressed by body weight and alternate, if one side congested so someone still can breath after the flattern one had expanded\n\nJust not much people can withstand coldness of icy water since dipping could last for 4 hours, if fever refuse to subdue or that's life of allergic patients since their disease only have a chart as precaution measures, no cure.\nAnd that only, if their symptoms being mild since allergic to peanut could kill, less than a minutes or what happen to Wongsu bestfriend in Indonesia since Vietnam coffee add peanut powder to enrich aroma.\n\nSHORTNESS OF BREATH \nThis symptom indeed related to covid patients or how deep you breath, cannot reach ending or capacity of lungs only left 50% mean your breathing only reach halfway since lungs already full or air cannot go in, no matter how deep you inhale. \nUnless air inside your lung released 1st before inhaling process repeat or why the patient breathing, looks kind of short. \n\nCos shortness of breath were not the same like dying patients that have difficulty breathing too since the symptoms were about something congested and eating space inside the lungs that need to be forced out. That is why, sideway sleeping indeed the better choice, compared to oxygen tank since one of the lungs were compressed by body weight during the process, forcing what congested inside, could come out. \n\nThat is also the reason, oxygen tank only suitable for coma patients or why they cannot die unless the hose were pulled. Not for induced coma or covid patient since they not needed the hose to be pulled, for the same purpose. \n\nAnd don't forget, this method to counter disease that don't have cure, come from doctor too cos patient cannot make decision or dip into icy water after admitted to hospital.\nJust doctors in old days indeed different compared to those, nowadays \n\nCHRONIC PATIENT VS VACCINE \nVaccine cannot help inview of forbidding you from dying after infected by covid. \nWhy? Cos chronic patient mean their organ were getting old or cannot perform at full capacity, when immune system dealing with virus that entered the body. \nThat is why, chronic patient ended up death even they were fully vaccinated or their death were not because their immune system were weak since chronic patient mean sickness related to their organ. \n\nBOOSTER SHOT \nThis thing indeed useless since vaccines cannot help chronic patients even after 10 shot cos it cannot ensure their organ rejuvenated or perform like, when they were young. \n\nAnd the main problem, \neveryone would get old insense you and chronic patient have no different since they were once, young and healthy like you. \nThen how to see vaccine can protect you upon your age reached 50, when your organ start deteriorating or cannot perform at high capacity?\u00a0 \n(Google \"Danny Woo Vk\" in Bing for book of life, A science book that don't exist in human world and share out my comment, so other aware how to counter covid were not using oxygen tank, so do read book of life in my vk profile). \n\nOMICRON\nThis variant were different and could reinfect the same patient within 2 day or immune system somehow could not function like other diseases. \n\nCos reinfection usual would not happen since healed patients would be immuned against the same disease or the main reason, why amount of daily patients yet to peak even keep breaching new levels. \n\nTo stop Omicron indeed have a method or force the disease change behaviour. \nSince method to counter diseases, have many way and not a must, use medicine. \n\nHOT CHICKEN FEATHER BATH\u00a0 \nThis method based on, why chicken egg could last for 28 days before it start rotting or what protecting the egg, could be found in chicken feather. \n\nCos the bath that a bit sticky upon dried up, could seal off human poreholes and if could last for 12 hours, whatever body waste unless solid, would be discharge thru urine, including covid. \n\nCovid only dangerous, if airborne or could not infect other, if its surrounding were liquid base. \nThat is why, the bath cannot be cleaned up, till the next day even it abit smelly. \n\nIf outbreak could be stopped upon infecting you, mean Omicron would subside like other variant. \nAnd don't ask why, someone knew such method since you will never understand, if you were not allergic patients. \nJust share out the method since someone used it before, so he could avoid hospital upon ingested allergic stuff..\nCos the method that could force disease change behaviour, not only about chicken feather bath but also need 4 chicken egg. \n33400",

Cos human still can breath using one lungs after another compressed by body weight and alternate, if one side congested so someone still can breath after the flattern one had expanded\n\nJust not much people can withstand coldness of icy water since dipping could last for 4 hours, if fever refuse to subdue or that's life of allergic patients since their disease only have a chart as precaution measures, no cure.\nAnd that only, if their symptoms being mild since allergic to peanut could kill, less than a minutes or what happen to Wongsu bestfriend in Indonesia since Vietnam coffee add peanut powder to enrich aroma.\n\nSHORTNESS OF BREATH \nThis symptom indeed related to covid patients or how deep you breath, cannot reach ending or capacity of lungs only left 50% mean your breathing only reach halfway since lungs already full or air cannot go in, no matter how deep you inhale. \nUnless air inside your lung released 1st before inhaling process repeat or why the patient breathing, looks kind of short. \n\nCos shortness of breath were not the same like dying patients that have difficulty breathing too since the symptoms were about something congested and eating space inside the lungs that need to be forced out. That is why, sideway sleeping indeed the better choice, compared to oxygen tank since one of the lungs were compressed by body weight during the process, forcing what congested inside, could come out. \n\nThat is also the reason, oxygen tank only suitable for coma patients or why they cannot die unless the hose were pulled. Not for induced coma or covid patient since they not needed the hose to be pulled, for the same purpose. \n\nAnd don't forget, this method to counter disease that don't have cure, come from doctor too cos patient cannot make decision or dip into icy water after admitted to hospital.\nJust doctors in old days indeed different compared to those, nowadays \n\nCHRONIC PATIENT VS VACCINE \nVaccine cannot help inview of forbidding you from dying after infected by covid. \nWhy? Cos chronic patient mean their organ were getting old or cannot perform at full capacity, when immune system dealing with virus that entered the body. \nThat is why, chronic patient ended up death even they were fully vaccinated or their death were not because their immune system were weak since chronic patient mean sickness related to their organ. \n\nBOOSTER SHOT \nThis thing indeed useless since vaccines cannot help chronic patients even after 10 shot cos it cannot ensure their organ rejuvenated or perform like, when they were young. \n\nAnd the main problem, \neveryone would get old insense you and chronic patient have no different since they were once, young and healthy like you. \nThen how to see vaccine can protect you upon your age reached 50, when your organ start deteriorating or cannot perform at high capacity?\u00a0 \n(Google \"Danny Woo Vk\" in Bing for book of life, A science book that don't exist in human world and share out my comment, so other aware how to counter covid were not using oxygen tank, so do read book of life in my vk profile). \n\nOMICRON\nThis variant were different and could reinfect the same patient within 2 day or immune system somehow could not function like other diseases. \n\nCos reinfection usual would not happen since healed patients would be immuned against the same disease or the main reason, why amount of daily patients yet to peak even keep breaching new levels. \n\nTo stop Omicron indeed have a method or force the disease change behaviour. \nSince method to counter diseases, have many way and not a must, use medicine. \n\nHOT CHICKEN FEATHER BATH\u00a0 \nThis method based on, why chicken egg could last for 28 days before it start rotting or what protecting the egg, could be found in chicken feather. \n\nCos the bath that a bit sticky upon dried up, could seal off human poreholes and if could last for 12 hours, whatever body waste unless solid, would be discharge thru urine, including covid. \n\nCovid only dangerous, if airborne or could not infect other, if its surrounding were liquid base. \nThat is why, the bath cannot be cleaned up, till the next day even it abit smelly. \n\nIf outbreak could be stopped upon infecting you, mean Omicron would subside like other variant. \nAnd don't ask why, someone knew such method since you will never understand, if you were not allergic patients. \nJust share out the method since someone used it before, so he could avoid hospital upon ingested allergic stuff..\nCos the method that could force disease change behaviour, not only about chicken feather bath but also need 4 chicken egg. \n33400",
