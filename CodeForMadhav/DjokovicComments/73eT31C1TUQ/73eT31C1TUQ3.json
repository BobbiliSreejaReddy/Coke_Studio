The Rapid one came out negative on 16th and 17th, and because he wasn't feeling any symptoms, he concluded that he could go out(that was wrong but it still explains why he decided to go)\n2. He wouldn't have incurred any loss if he would have stated that he had travelled to Spain. They weren't going to deny him because he had travelled to Spain so therfore it was a mistake and not a lie. Such mistakes do happen and are corrected at the airport itself (The former immigration minister told this at abc news). The way it is being put sounds like he lied to get in\n3. In the deportation letter made by the immigration minister, section 14D stated that \u201cNovak was a man on good grounds\"- implying he had not broken any rules. In section 15 he states that \u201cNovak is an ineligible risk to the community\"- implying his medical exemption was valid. He was kicked out from the country because the minister thought his presence might excite antivax sentiment which may cause civil unrest.\n4. The second hearing was not on the basis of the merit of the decision (Therfore natural justice wasn't allowed to Novak), it was on the basis that whether there was a legal error in the deportation or not. The immigration ministers power in this case is so strong that he just needs to prove that his decision was rational, as proving if the decision was right or wrong didn't matter according to the law.\n5. Two other players also came under the same circumstances before Novak came but were kicked out after Novak came.\n6. There were elections within 3 moths in Australia and most of the county wanted him out the country.\n7. The PM said ge would be deported if his medical exemption wasn't sufficient, but the immigration minister did say that his exemption was valid.\n\nI request you to put the full side of the story \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\nYou said- \"A player, who despite organisational and government rules flew to Australia\" which makes people think that he broke the rules.",

It was his positive PCR-test, which takes much longer to process, that he did not see the results from until after the event.\n2) In the image of photographs with dates that you show a couple of times, the dates of the interview and the kids event seem switched, making it look like he attended the more crowded event later, after receiving the positive test result.

It surprised me that the judge said that they had only made a judgement on the legality and not the merit of the immigration minister's decision, effectively saying that they did not care about the reasoning behind the decision, only if he had made any legal errors in executing his power, meaning that there really was no case from the start. This was different to what everyone had lead me to believe.\n\nThere was also the case of some saying that his test result was faked.

He also had plenty of time to decide to get vaccinated to avoid this whole scenario but he chose not to, he made his personal choice as an adult despite the possible outcome. And as many viewers here would already know, Djokovic is no stranger to controversy and he's made many questionable decisions (e.g. Adria Tour, PTPA, refusing to admit he needed to change his on-court behaviour eventually leading to his default at the US Open, his stubborn refusal to get elbow surgery and crying for days after the surgery - which by the way after that he's won 8 slams out of 10 finals). A lot of NoleFam fans are bitter at Australia about his treatment. Yes the detention and handling by Australia was terrible, but they need to remember that Novak made his decision not to take the vaccine and it was his choice, other Serbian players participated in Australia without any issues. For some of his supporters to portray him as someone who is standing up for the oppressed, let's set the record straight, Novak is a guy who has benefitted and earnt more career prize money than any other players in the history of the sport.\n\nFrom the Australian Federal Government and Victorian State Government perspective - this whole saga exposed some serious problems and it was heavily-politicised. Ultimately the Federal Government managed the borders and they had the right to deport Djokovic, but it also exposed their incompetence and the treatment of refugees in detention. The Victorian State Government got cold feet and in particular Jaala Pulford deserves a special mention. She did not shy away from the fact she was a big Nadal fan and wanted him to win (and I think there can be very little doubt she did not want Djokovic to get in his way) - they were the ones who pulled the rug under Djokovic - because the state government was working with Tennis Australia in creating the medical exemption panels (they created this process and when pressured withdrew their support when pressured by the Federal Government). There is simply no way Djokovic would have flown to Melbourne knowing he would be detained. It also yet again exposed how different levels of government were not working or effectively talking with each other.\n\nRegarding Tennis Australia - they were warned by the Federal Government previously that vaccination was mandatory and yet they still proceeded with the medical panel. The medical exemption panel process was also questionable particularly the dates/timeline - as another post pointed out the discrepancy between the application due date and Djokovic's submission. Djokovic was allowed to make his submission around a week past the due date.\n\nLastly about the vaccination requirements to enter the tournament - this policy made sense when Delta was the most common strain in Australia, but Omicron had become the dominant strain in late December and January, and it's fairly evident that the current vaccines have reduced efficacy on Omicron. We've already seen vaccinated players having COVID infections (particularly those who participated at the Abu Dhabi exhibition events). How could anyone reasonably assert Djokovic could pose a serious threat on public health when Victoria was having thousands of new cases daily during this period?  Australians have a strong belief that everyone should be made to comply to the same rules (e.g. no special treatment for celebrities etc.), however we are talking about a very significant global event here, if they can't work their way around this and make special arrangements / dispensations, it really leads me to question whether they are competent enough to host this event.",

Djokovic won his first court case and I understand that Djokovic did something majorly wrong by going out when he had covid, he got the exemption legally. You can\u2019t just tell someone you can enter the country and then immediately change your mind, even if the Australian public thinks so. It\u2019s clearly not fair to Djokovic. Screw you Alex Hawke. Regardless this was a great video and I really enjoyed it.",
