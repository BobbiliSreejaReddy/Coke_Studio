                        "textDisplay": "Novak had a valid medical exemption to enter Australia from the federal and Victorian government. He is not the only tennis player or regular citizen to enter Australia unvaccinated with a medical exemption, please get your facts straight. He lost his final court appeal because of the \"personal powers\" the Australian Immigration Minister decided to use, not because he was unvaccinated. The Minister deported Novak because he felt Novak's so called \"anti-vax beliefs\" would be a threat to civil society in Australia (a country that already has over 92% of the population doubled vaxed). I watched all the live stream court hearings so I am well aware of the legal arguments and final decisions made by the court. Novak was deported for his \"thoughts/beliefs\" based partly on a comment he made around March 2020 where he said he hoped there would not be any mandates. Deporting an individual for their \"thoughts/beliefs\" is a scary precedent to set.\n\nIn regards to \"natural\" vs \"un-natural\" interventions, one can have a strong preference for natural means, however one should always have the choice of what goes into one's body or what procedures they have. I'm sure he would have preferred to heal his elbow \"naturally\" but in that specific case you mention he decided to go with western medical intervention, that was his choice, this was not forced upon him. He does not have to take the vaccine, the vaccine does not prevent infection, transmission, hospitalization or even death. This is his choice to make. This is what so many people, including Novak, are standing up for. Personal medical choice and freedom. When did he say he was smarter than you? He is making personal medical choices for himself, that is not selfish or arrogant, that is taking care of oneself so one can contribute to society. I unfortunately have numerous friends that have been vaccine injured, hospitalized and medically diagnosed by doctors with myocarditis and pericarditis from the vaccine. Furthermore, professional tennis player Jeremy Chardy had an adverse reaction as well and had to stop playing tennis. I hope you consider and respect this different perspective I have taken the time to present. We are all trying our best to navigate these challenging times.",
