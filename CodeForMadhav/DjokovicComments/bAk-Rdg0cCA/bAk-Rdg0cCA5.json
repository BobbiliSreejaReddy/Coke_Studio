When I had an employer who demanded a medical certificate if you take a day sickleave, I went to a doctor, who then immediately prescribed antibiotics, and I just tore it up. I still believe it was the best thing to do. Patients who have been coerced to take one course of antibiotics after the other - not to save lives, but just because the doctor wants to feel that he's done something, were not well served by their doctor, and indeed, the entire world has been screwed over by doctors' indiscriminate use of antibiotics.",

Is there any chance... you know... is there any chance YOU'd play the Wimbledon tourney this year?\n\nOf course I'm being funny, but you know, funnier things have happened! Who knows!\n\nWonderful video, as always. Wonderful message too. I too have the exact same position. I am a vaccine guy, I have no problems taking vaccines all my life, getting a boatload of injections, getting (all) my teeth extracted... I actually enjoy these procedures. So in no way can I claim to be an \"anti-vaxxer\", nor can anyone call me an \"anti-vaxxer\". In fact I have a rather large (well, hen's egg-sized) fibrosis on my upper left arm, the result of a BCG injection (or vaccine?) that I received as a child.\nBut what I'm opposed to tooth and nail is this whole idea of \"mandates\" that effectively undercut my basic human rights. Like, this \"neo-caste\" distinction - the vaccinated get to do this, that, and the other; the unvaxxed cannot travel or attend functions or (in some extreme cases) even move out of their houses. This is extremely anti-human.\nAnother thing is... why this extremely obvious force on getting vaxxed? They have started abusing ppl who are unvaxxed, so much so, ppl are being called anti-social, anti-science, and even anti-national! Can you imagine? A person's patriotism is being called into question over the issue of his vax status! What a world! What a horrible, horrible situation this is!\nFurthermore.... why are governments (all over the world) glossing over the meaning and import of \"emergency use authorization\"? If the vaccines that we have so far are \"emergency use\" only, then they should be used ONLY and STRICTLY for those cases that are death-bed patients. Mass vaccination campaigns cannot use \"emergency use\" vaccines. Anyone who receives an emergency use vax must realize that he is being used as a volunteer in an EXPERIMENT. These EUA vaccines are EXPERIMENTAL vaccines.\n\nOne oft-repeated argument is that we have already received so many (classical) vaccines before... why are we baulking at these (new C-19) vaccines? An associated argument is that no one doubts the efficacy of the prevalent (classical) vaccines such as that for poliomyelitis. \"Just look at the wonder of the polio vaccine! Would you rather your child contract polio?\"\nWe are indeed grateful for the polio vaccine and so many other vaccines to date. BUT! But why is it not clarified that the mRNA vaccine is not typical of the prevalent vaccines? Why is it that the public at large is unaware of the types of vaccines that are on offer for this pandemic? Why is it that governments are NOT educating their citizens about the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of vaccines being deployed for this pandemic? \nSo first of all they (the government authorities) make no effort at all to educate the ppl about the different types of vaccines.\nThen they FORCE the ppl to get vaxxed.\nAnd that too they force the ppl to get vaxxed with a vaccine that the ppl know (virtually) nothing about, and have no option in choosing.\nIt is a fact... in most cases a person has no choice in the type or brand of vaccine that he'll be given. He just has to line up, sign away his right to legal redress, and offer his arm to get jabbed. This is shocking in 2020 where the world is so heavily into smartphones and digitization.\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for your stand on this issue. It is truly encouraging for us, the lay public.\n\nHC-JAIPUR (16/02/2022)",

The reason people are calling him \"selfish\" is because people have literally been brainwashed by the government and mainstream media to believe that anyone that makes a personal choice about their own body is \"selfish\" which is absolutely not the case. Anyone that does not wish to take the vaccine for whatever reason also gets automatically labelled as an \"anti vaxxer\" which is another popular toxic media label these days that has been used as an attempt to divide people and it is simply not true btw, just because you decide not to take something does not make you \"anti\" that thing.
