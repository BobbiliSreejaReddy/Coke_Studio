The assessment was made on information supplied, which the Tennis Australia chief medic has stated were not investigated re: veracity and authenticity of claims because \u2018they aren\u2019t investigators\u2019.\nHowever, while he had permission to play the Australian Open, he has not satisfied the requirements to enter into Australia. \nToday, letters from Greg Hunt to Craig Tiley have been leaked which revealed the following:\n- previous infection with COVID does not satisfy the requirement of being fully vaccinated\n- quarantine-free travel can only be given to those who are considered fully vaccinated.\n- AIR can only be used for domestic citizens, and foreign exemptions are not worth the paper they are written on when it comes to Australian borders.\n- ATAGI is not responsible for the Border control and Border Force states that people must be fully vaccinated under ATAGI definitions to gain quarantine free travel into Australia. \n- more robust evidence of medical contraindication to vaccination must be presented at the border.\nWe know that at 4pm today Novak Djokovic is challenging his deportation in Federal Circuit Court.\nIn light of these documents, I predict that one of two things will happen: \n1. He will be deported and then need to reapply with the correct documentation IF he has it\nOR\n2. He will be forced into a two week quarantine like any other unvaccinated person seeking entrance to Australia. \nWatch this space.\nDr Sara Marzouk\nCraig Tiley was told, repeatedly, the conditions of entering Australia. State exemptions to attend events don\u2019t supersede Federal border requirements for entry.",
                        "textOriginal": "For those following along at home and asking \u201cwhy was Novak denied entry when two panels had given him a medical exemption?\u201d let me explain.\nNovak somehow was able to get a medical exemption from the Victorian Government to attend the Australian Open. The assessment was made on information supplied, which the Tennis Australia chief medic has stated were not investigated re: veracity and authenticity of claims because \u2018they aren\u2019t investigators\u2019.\nHowever, while he had permission to play the Australian Open, he has not satisfied the requirements to enter into Australia. \nToday, letters from Greg Hunt to Craig Tiley have been leaked which revealed the following:\n- previous infection with COVID does not satisfy the requirement of being fully vaccinated\n- quarantine-free travel can only be given to those who are considered fully vaccinated.\n- AIR can only be used for domestic citizens, and foreign exemptions are not worth the paper they are written on when it comes to Australian borders.\n- ATAGI is not responsible for the Border control and Border Force states that people must be fully vaccinated under ATAGI definitions to gain quarantine free travel into Australia. \n- more robust evidence of medical contraindication to vaccination must be presented at the border.\nWe know that at 4pm today Novak Djokovic is challenging his deportation in Federal Circuit Court.\nIn light of these documents, I predict that one of two things will happen: \n1. He will be deported and then need to reapply with the correct documentation IF he has it\nOR\n2. He will be forced into a two week quarantine like any other unvaccinated person seeking entrance to Australia. \nWatch this space.\nDr Sara Marzouk\nCraig Tiley was told, repeatedly, the conditions of entering Australia. State exemptions to attend events don\u2019t supersede Federal border requirements for entry.",
