He is a guy that mostly cares about traditional values and absolute freedom, and stubornly refuses to comply or answer to anyone that endanger those freedoms. Kind like me, an average Ortodox Serb \ud83d\ude01. Jokes aside, i also think that he doesnt trust authorities about this pandemic from the very beggining, not about the problems people face or the virus itself, but about the efficiency and legitimacy of all this vaccination stuff and all these new strains of Covid ? Where do they come from ? Why is natural imunity weaker than vaccine imunity ? Why so much unknowns about the virus that has been arround for 2 years already, and by some medical expers much longer than that ?. All these questions probably made Novak worried about his health, and all the preasures he was exposed to over the years from the western media even before Corona virus. And who can blame him. There are a lot of people like him. This entire pandemic was handled by the world in the same way Australia goverment handled this situation with Djokovic. Incompetently and illogically. I also think people who think Djokovic is a bad guy are just some dumb haters that hate on anyone that disagrees with their own projection of the world. He is not a bad guy, but he is a defient guy, maybe even to defient sometimes which makes him seem arrogant. And there is a huge difference between being defient and being arrogant. This trait of his causes him to get into trouble and conflict with people. And when you are famous and powerful like him, unquestuonably you will make enemies arround the world, because what you say or do becomes relevant to a lot of people. Djokovic has his stance, he is not neutral like for example Nadal, that is only interested in his own benefit. Federer to. Djokovic isnt built like that. So, inevitably he will make more enemies. There is also bias of the west towards their champions, which is for me understandable, there is bias for Djokovic and the likes of him in the east, also understandable. I wish these things and everything that happened was avoidable. To bad, it had to come to this and it should simply be about tennis and sport, not go as far as politics. A lot of emotions from all sides, its a mess. A circus. Wrong people will suffer from this, its sad.",
