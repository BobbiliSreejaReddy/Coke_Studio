They tipped it over the line for the Australian  authorities to use 'good order' reasons to deport him from the country, because public sentiments against  Djokovic solidified after those little episodes. It may have felt better for them to behave badly, some also say in an over-the-top, nationalistic and fanatical manner, but it worked against Djokovic and he himself was more than likely hoping they kept quiet as he knew it wasn't helping his cause. Hope there's a lesson in that for some people.",

The government from hold on don't get the A.Z. vaccine if under 50 to get the vaccines which ever you can get in June. Than ran a fear campaign with the help of media. The has mandate for many work places and for everyone else if you don't get the vaccine you were told (threatened) you will not be allowed to travel, International or across state borders in Australia, everything from medical, work ,education and social life was threatened with you will not be allowed unless vaccinated and  were told if you get the jab life will turn back to before covid restrictions. Most Australians went fuk it then give us the jab so we open the country. Australia is now the most vaccinated Adult population in the world at 95%. The only rule that has really changed is now only vaccinated can travel. The borders open just before December and covid has explode from  a few thousand a day to over a 100,000 a day. In the 6 to 7 weeks covid has hospital straining to the point all non life threatening surgery is cancelled and ambulance can take hours to arrive. Supply chains for food and medical supplies are breaking down all form staff shortage's due to covid infection. All the thing's the government told us would not happen in Australia like happen in other parts of the world. Happened and it less than 2 months to happen and still a large majority of Australians trust the government and the media lies they are told. To in fear to see our government is failure. They have had months and months over a year to work things vaccine exemption out. It just staggers me that so many have allowed there fear to blind them. What threat is healthy person to our country he is more likely to catch the dam virus of a Aussie than give it to the country. People have lost there minds, they applauded the government a few months ago when they used air force and charter airlines to fly thousands of Afghani's in after the failed withdrawal and fall of Afghanistan. Yet howled when fit health person come's to play to tennis for ten days.  1 will make dollars turn over in Australia and go home. The other will cost Australia a fortune and will not leave the country. Australia has election's this year and I will not be voting for turd government. I wish Novak all the best.",

So glad to see someone speaking up and just spilling facts. Loved the part about being part of a polarised society which does not leave room for grey areas, middle ground seems to be non-existent.\n\nBeen a subscriber for quite a lot of time and I honestly don't really know why you haven't reached the 10K mark yet, so much phenomenal and insightful content. If you want our Spanish subscribers to discover your channel (and your witty character), you can always have a place at our lives in the Puntodebreak channel in the upcoming weeks (hey, might as well give it a shot) ;) \n\nKind regards, Illya, and all the best for the following tournaments! :)",
