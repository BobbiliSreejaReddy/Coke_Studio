                        "textDisplay": "The AO needs Djokovic more than he needs this tournament. This is coming from a person who doesn\u2019t follow sports. An observation of an impartial walker-by based on impromptu fact research as this affair has caught my interest. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if other prominent players & attendees pulled out of the championship and so undermined the economic viability of organizing such an event when now the top three players in the world will not play with Nadal being Covid positive & Federer not attending. Who would bother buying a ticket to watch a game when the best player in the world isn\u2019t going to be allowed to play to defend his title, what will the title even be worth to the winner? All that just for laughable & egoistic, bureaucratic, ignorant, illogical, unreasonable, primitive, literally idiotic political acts. The whole point of vaccination is to gain immunity. Banning a person, who had previously naturally contracted the virus twice, as Djokovic had, for not being vaccinated is just plain stupid when he would arguably have better immunity to the virus from the natural infections than any vaccinated person who has never been exposed to the virus. Recovered Covid-19 patients are medically ineligible for a vaccine for a period of at least 6 months. Undoubtedly, the reasoning behind the cancellation was driven by other ulterior political motives and utterly unsubstantiated concerns judging Djokovic's past participation in other grand slam tournaments around the globe in the last 12 months did not have the effect the immigration officials stated as the reasons for the visa cancellation.  \r\n\r\nWhat sense does it make to still have border restrictions? The virus has spread out throughout the entire globe, it's here just like everywhere else, so whom are you protecting and against what by restricting people from international travel? Is it because Australia still foolishly believes that they're going wipe the virus out on their home soil & those few 10s of new cases that could potentially arrive on international flights would make that goal unachievable? You currently have 1.26 million active cases and those are just the known cases, while the real number is far greater considering how fast the virus is spreading. This can only be described as the highest grade of clueless incompetence. \r\n\r\nThe government\u2019s behaviour & approach has been an Australian mentality problem for a long time, tendency to think you are more important than you actually are. A part of the reason why the rest of the developed world has laughed at this country for their feeling of self-importance. And this comes from a first-hand source, somebody who was born & raised in one of the other parts of the developed world who knows how Australia is perceived over there. Look when the PM attends global summits and the rest of the world\u2019s developed country leaders aren\u2019t even bothered to turn up when the Australian PM is due to speak on global issues. Just one piece of evidence to highlight the fact, reflecting the respect Australia has in the world.  \r\n\r\nDoes Australia deserve better considering incidents of this nature? This Djokovic affair is nothing else than a desperate & laughable attempt for attention accentuating Australia\u2019s feeling of self-importance and/or evidence that parts of the system here are flawed and it, at times, doesn\u2019t even know what happens within itself. Good on Novak for not giving in to the so-called \u201cdemocratic\u201d government\u2019s machinery and its \u201cdemocratic\u201d means of \u201cdemocratically\u201d manipulating its citizens into making the preferred \u201cdemocratic\u201d choices. Then the PM says thanks to their pandemic policies Australia has ONE OF the lowest Covid-19 mortality rates in the world? So not the best! And more importantly at what cost? Forcing your citizens to live under the most severe draconian, authoritarian, dictatorship-like restrictions taking away their basic personal freedoms? Any other country would achieve the same result if they treated their citizens that way. Preventing your own citizens from returning to their own country during a pandemic? What a joke! The world is laughing and shaking its head in disbelief. And all that only to realise what a lot of us and many other countries had realised much earlier. There is no way to wipe this virus out and we have to start to live with it. And so they finally did even in Australia, and again, way later than the rest of the world who much earlier allowed their citizens to live a much freer life which is why Australia has managed to keep their flaunted \u2018pandemic management score\u2019 slightly better than the rest of the world which they so proudly like to compare themselves to while dictatorship-like measures were being imposed upon the Australian nation for an unreasonably long time only to arrive at the conclusion that they\u2019re useless and are not going to work unless you literally stop living your life and sit at home \u2026but again, a realisation made so much later than the rest of the world. Are they really so clueless, naive, out of touch with reality? Now, after the belated realisation, finally!! they\u2019ve let the virus \u2018rip\u2019 as they say, and behold, soaring new cases nearing 100 000 daily despite the high double vaccination, 20-40 new deaths daily, one example from three days ago 29 new deaths in NSW only four of which were unvaccinated, two fully vaccinated people in their 20s died from natural infection with no underlying conditions. Do you still want to tell me the vaccines actually do something other than occasionally cause severe illness or death in some people? Let\u2019s see where your lauded pandemic policies take you now, Mr PM, now that your country has returned back to reality. And let\u2019s see how long it will take them (and some other countries) to realise that even the vaccine mandates aren\u2019t a solution. One must seriously start to think that this world is filled with dumb absolutely clueless and essentially useless idiots incapable of making a sober, impartial and objective decision looking at the reality, irrespective of how politically unacceptable it may seem at first. Politics have always been stupid and subjective, only rarely objective, fair, impartial and honest, simply because it\u2019s done by human beings who are flawed in their very essence. How can the governments around the world be so naive and stupid as to believe the vaccine manufacturers who claim THEIR PRODUCTS are safe and will not have any negative long-term side effects. No one on Earth could possibly know that. Did they know about the now well-documented and very real short-term negative side effects that some people experience caused by their vaccines? Did they tell anybody that some people will develop heart problems, have blood clots, or die when they first released the vaccines? No, because they either didn\u2019t know or chose not to reveal it hoping the benefits would outweigh the low percentage possibility of such severe adverse reactions or death. Now they even openly admit they don\u2019t know the reason why some people experience those reactions or die. What else do they not know, and how long will it take to show? You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. Only time will tell whether there will be any long-term so far unknown negative side-effects in all the vaccinated people that will likely take years to develop and manifest by symptoms. Their claim that the vaccines are safe, just because not a long enough time has passed yet to be able to gather data to support such an audacious claim, can technically only be categorized as hope, not a fact. And considering a part of the terms of the agreement under which the vaccine manufacturers sell their vaccines to the governments is a clause that indemnifies them from any legal liability for negative side-effects, I don\u2019t know why they would be cautious about making such a bold claim when they\u2019ll never face any consequences if they get it wrong while there is no one in the world with greater vested interest to issue such statements to profit from the sale of their product.  \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to take away from the fact that they probably do their best to develop a safe vaccine, but just because one does their best doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s enough & gonna work. Especially when it\u2019s in a relatively new and not thoroughly understood science domain such as the mRNA technology being used for this purpose for the very first time. Making such an unsubstantiated claim is very irresponsible and arrogant. They can only claim they hope the vaccines are safe based on what they know so far, which obviously is not everything and only time will show what they didn\u2019t know.  \r\n\r\nYou can call us anti-vaxxers if you like, but there are many among us incl. myself who have been vaccinated against many things and we only stay away from this new type of vaccine that had never been used before in history, and which unlike other traditional, non-mRNA vaccines known from the past, has statistically caused long-term severe illness and death in more people than any other previous vaccine. How many people have died from receiving the tetanus vaccine? And covid-19 vaccine? The developments clearly contradict the vaccine safety & effectiveness statements. The truth & common sense will always prevail in the end. It will only take some time and a thick skin against the endless brainless insults & attacks in the meantime.",

Handled differently by the authorities this issue could have been a chance to make a solid U-turn in some topics. Please read: \n1) Minimize damage and save lives. The overall goal of a pandemic should be to minimize damage and save lives. \n2) Human value. All people should be treated with respect and on equal terms. \n3) Personal integrity and freedom. Measures that restrict human integrity and freedom should be proportionate, necessary and relevant, and minimized in relation to what one wishes to achieve. \n4) Justice and equality. Care and other societal efforts must be offered in a fair and ethically acceptable manner. It is important to counteract inequality both nationally and internationally.\n5)  Scientific basis. Decisions on measures should, as far as possible, be based on scientific evidence and proven experience. \n6) Proportionality. The measures taken must be proportionate in relation to what one wishes to achieve. \n7) Trust. It is crucial that decision-makers maintain the public's confidence in the event of a pandemic when difficult measures must be taken. One way to build trust in the short and long term is to stick to the facts. \n8) Solidarity. A pandemic can challenge conventional ideas of national sovereignty, security or territoriality. It is important to support the individuals who are at risk of particular harm due to infection or measures, as well as to emphasize the individual's responsibility for their own choices.",
